    "# Access Controls\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook talks about two sides of the same coin: **identity management** and **access control**. The essence of information risk mitigation is ensuring that only the right people and processes can read, view, use, change, or remove any of our sensitive information assets, or use any of our most important information-based business processes. We also require the ability to prove who or what touched what information asset and when, and what happened when they did. We'll see how to authenticate that a subject user (be that a person or a software process) is who they claim to be; use predetermined policies to decide if they are authorized to do what they are attempting to do; and build and maintain accounting or audit information that shows us who asked to do what, when, where, and how."

    "## Implement & Maintain Authentication Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "SSCPs often need to deal with the \"triple-A\" of identity management and access control, which refers to authentication, authorization, and accounting.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Authentication** is the act of examining or testing the identity credentials provided by a subject that is requesting access, and based on information in the access control list, either granting (accepts) access, denying it, or requesting additional credential information before making an access determination:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Multifactor identification systems are a frequent example of access control systems asking for additional information: the user completes one sign-on step, and is then challenged for the second (or subsequent) factor.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* At the device level, access control systems may challenge a user's device (or one automatically attempting to gain access) to provide more detailed information about the status of software or malware definition file updates, and deny access to those systems not meeting criteria, or route them to restricted networks for remediation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Once an identity has been authenticated, the access control system determines just what capabilities that identity is allowed to perform. Authorization requires a two-step process:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Assigning privileges during provisioning**. Prior to the first access attempt, administrators must decide which permissions or privileges to grant to an identity, and whether additional constraints or conditions apply to those permissions. The results of those decisions are stored in access control tables or access control lists in the access control database.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Authorizing a specific access request**. After authenticating the identity, the access control system must then determine whether the specifics of the access request are allowed by the permissions set in the access control tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Accounting** gathers data from within the access control process to monitor the lifecycle of an access, from its initial request and permissions being granted through the interactions by the subject with the object, to capturing the manner in which the access is terminated. This provides the audit trail by which we address many key information security processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The Traffic Light Protocol (TLP) can be seen at www.us-cert.gov/tlp. It exists to make sharing of sensitive or private information easier to manage so that this community can balance the risks of damage to the reputation, business, or privacy of the source against the needs for better, more effective national response to computer emergency events.\n",

    "\n",
    "Each company or organization has to determine its own information security classification needs and devise a structure of categories that support and achieve those needs. They all have two properties in common, however, which are called the read-up and write-down problems:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Reading up** refers to a subject granted access at one level of the data classification stack, which then attempts to read information contained in objects classified at higher levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Writing down** refers to a subject granted access at one level that attempts to write or pass data classified at that level to a subject or object classified at a lower level.\n",
    "\n",
    "Shoulder-surfing is a simple illustration of the read-up problem, because it can allow an unauthorized person to masquerade as an otherwise legitimate user. A more interesting example of the read-up problem was seen in many login or sign-on systems, which would first check the login ID, and if that was correctly defined or known to the system, then solicit and check the password. This design inadvertently confirms the login ID is legitimate; compare this to designs that take both pieces of login information, and return \"user name or password unknown or in error\" if the input fails to be authenticated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Writing classified or proprietary information to a thumb drive, and then giving that thumb drive to an outsider, illustrates the write-down problem. Write-down also can happen if a storage device is not properly zeroized or randomized prior to its removal from the system for maintenance or disposal.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Single/Multifactor Authentication\n",
    "Compare and contrast single-factor and multifactor authentication. Typically, these refer to how human users gain access to systems. Each factor refers to something that the user has, knows, or is. Users can have identification cards or documents, electronic code-generating identity devices (such as key fobs or apps on a smartphone), or machine-readable identity cards. Users can know personally identifying information such as passwords, answers to secret questions, or details of their own personal or professional life. Users are their physical bodies, and biometric devices can measure their fingerprints, retinal vein patterns, voice patterns, or many other physiological characteristics that are reasonably unique to a specific individual and hard to mimic. Each type of factor, by itself, is subject to being illicitly copied and used to attempt to spoof identity for systems access. Use of each factor is subject to false positive errors (acceptance of a presented factor that is not the authentic one) and false negative errors (rejection of authentic factors), and they can be things that legitimate users may forget (such as passwords or leaving their second-factor authentication device or card at home). As you add more factors to user sign-on processes, you add complexity and costs. User frustration can also increase with additional factors being used, leading to attempts to cheat the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Single Sign-on\n",
    "Explain the advantages and disadvantages of single sign-on architectures. Initially, the design of systems and platform applications required users to present login credentials each time they attempted to use each of these different systems. This is both cumbersome and frustrating to users and difficult to manage from an identity provisioning and access control perspective. SSO (single sign-on) allows users to access an organization’s systems by only having to do one sign-on—they present their authentication credentials once. It uses an integrated identity and access control management (IAM) systems approach to bring together all information about all subjects (people or processes) and all objects (people, processes, and information assets, including networks and computers) into one access control list or database. SSO then generates a ticket or token, which is the authorization of that subject’s access privileges for that session. This can be implemented with systems like XTACACS, RADIUS, Microsoft Active Directory, and a variety of other products and systems, depending on the degree of integration the organization needs. SSO eliminates the hassle of using and maintaining multiple, platform-specific or system-specific sign-on access control lists; it does bring the risk that once into the system, users can access anything, including things outside of the scope, purview, or needs of their authorized duties and privileges. Properly implemented access control should provide that next level of “need to know” control and enforcement.\n",
    "### Device Authentication\n",
    "Explain why we need device authentication for information security, and briefly describe how it works. Access to company or organizational information assets usually requires physical and logical access, typically via the Physical, Data Link, and Network layers of a protocol stack such as TCP/IP. The CIANA needs of the organization will dictate what information needs what kinds of protection, and in most cases, this means that only trusted, authorized subjects (people, processes, or devices) should be authorized to access this information. That requires that the subject first authenticate its identity. Device authentication depends on some hardware characteristic, such as a MAC address, and may also depend on authentication of the software, firmware, or data stored on the device; this ensures that trusted devices that do not have required software updates or malware definition file updates, for example, are not allowed access. Further constraints might restrict even an authorized device from attempting to access the system from new, unknown, and potentially untrustworthy locations, times of day, etc. The authentication process requires the device to present such information, which the access control system uses to either confirm the claimed identity and authorize access, request additional information, or deny the request.\n",
    "### Federated Access\n",
    "Compare and contrast single sign-on and federated access. SSO, by itself, does not bridge one organization’s access control systems with those of other organizations, such as strategic partners, subcontractors, or key customers; this requires a federated identity and access management approach. Just as individual platform or system access is logically a subset of SSO, SSO is a subset of federated access. Federated identity management systems provide mechanisms for sharing identity and access information, which makes identity and access portable, allowing properly authorized subjects to access otherwise separate and distinct security domains. Federated access uses open standards, such as the OASIS Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML), and technologies such as OAuth, OpenID, various security token approaches, Web service specifications, Windows Identity Foundation, and others. Federated access systems typically use Web-based SSO for user access."

    "## Support Internetwork Trust Architectures\n",
    "\n",
    "Describe what internetwork trust architectures are and how they are used. When two or more organizations need their physically and logically separate networks to collaborate together, this requires some form of sharing of identity and access control information. Internetwork trust architectures are the combination of systems, technologies, and processes used by the two organizations to support this interorganizational collaboration. This will typically require some sort of federated access system.\n",
    "### Trust Relationships (e.g., 1-Way, 2-Way, Transitive)\n",
    "Explain what a zero trust network is and its role in organizational information security. Zero trust network design and access control reflect the need to counter the more advanced persistent threats and the increasing risk of data exfiltration associated with many of them. This shifts the security focus from the perimeter to step-by-step, node-by-node movement and action within the organization’s information infrastructure. Instead of large, easily managed networks or segments, zero trust designs seek to micro-segment the network. Fully exploiting the capabilities of attribute-based access control, the zero trust approach promises to more effectively contain a threat, whether an outsider or insider, and thus limit the possibility of damage or loss. It’s sometimes called the “never trust, always verify” approach, and for good reason.\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain how one-way, two-way, and transitive trust relationships are used in a chain of trust. It’s simplest to start with one-way trust: node A is the authoritative source of trusted information about a topic, and since the builders of node B know this, node B can trust the information it is given by node A. This would require that the transmission of information from node A to B meets nonrepudiation and integrity requirements. Two-way trust is actually the overlap of two separate one-way trust relationships: node A is trusted by node B, which in turn is trusted by node A. Now, if node C trusts node B, then transitivity says that node C also trusts node A. This demonstrates a simple chain of trust: node A is trusted by B, which is trusted by C. This chain of trust concept is fundamental to certificates, key distribution, integrated and federated access control, and a host of other processes critical to creating and maintaining the confidentiality, integrity, authorization, nonrepudiability, and availability of information.\n",
    "One-way and two-way trust are most often applied to domains of users: organization A trusts its users and trusts the users of its strategic partner B, but organization B does not have the same level of trust for organization A’s users. This often happens during mergers, temporary partnerships or alliances, or the migration of subsets of an organization’s users from one set of platforms to another.\n",
    "### Extranet\n",
    "Describe the use of an extranet and important information security considerations with using extranets. An extranet is a virtual extension to an organization’s intranet (internal LAN) system, which allows outside organizations to have a greater degree of collaboration, information sharing, and use of information and systems of both organizations. For example, a parts wholesaler might use an extranet to share wholesale catalogs, or filtered portions thereof, with specific sets of key customers or suppliers. Extranets typically look to provide application-layer shared access and may do this as part of a SOA approach. Prior to the widespread adoption of VPN technologies, organizations needed significant investment in additional hardware, network systems, software, and personnel to design, deploy, maintain, and keep their extranets secure. In many industries, the use of industry-focused applications provided as a service (SaaS or PaaS cloud models, for example) can take on much of the implementation and support burden of a traditional extranet. As with any network access, careful attention to identity management and access control is a must!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Third Party Connections\n",
    "Explain the role of third-party connections in trust architectures. In many trust architectures, either one of the parties is the anchor of the trust chain, and thus issues trust credentials for others in the architecture to use, or a trusted third party, not actually part of the architecture per se, is the provider of this information. One such role is that of a credential service provider (CSP), which (upon request) generates and provides an object or data structure that establishes the link between an identity and its associated attributes, to a subscriber to that CSP. Other examples of third parties are seen in the ways that digital certificates and encryption keys are generated, issued, and used.\n",

    "## Participate in the Identity Management Lifecycle\n",
    "\n",
    "In an information systems context, an identity is a set of credentials associated with (or bound to) an individual user, process, device, or other entity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the process we identify an identity:\n",
    "* We ask (or the device offers) a claim as to who or what it is.\n",
    "* The claimant offers further supporting information that attests to the truth of that claim.\n",
    "* We verify the believability (the credibility or trustworthiness) of that supporting information.\n",
    "* We ask for additional supporting information, or we ask a trusted third party to authenticate that information.\n",
    "* Finally, we conclude that the subject is whom or what it claims to be.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **identity management lifecycle** describes the series of steps in which a subject's identity is initially created, initialized for use, modified as needs and circumstances change, and finally retired from authorized use in a particular information system. These steps are typically referred to as provisioning, review, and revocation of an identity:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Provisioning** starts with the initial claim of identity and a request to create a set of credentials for that identity; typically, a responsible manager in the organization must approve requests to provision new identities. Key to this step is **identity proofing**, which separately validates that the evidence of identity as submitted by the applicant is truthful, authoritative, and current. Once created, the identity management functions have to deploy that identity to all of the access control systems protecting all of the objects that the new identity will need access to. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Review** is the ongoing process that checks whether the set of access privileges granted to a subject are still required or if any should be modified or removed. **Privilege creep** happens when duties have changed and yet privileges that are no longer actually needed remain in effect for a given user.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Revocation** is the formal process of terminating access privileges for a specific identity in a system.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Authorization\n",
    "Explain the role of authentication, authorization, and accounting in identity management and access control terms. These three processes (the “AAA” of access control) are the fundamental functions of an access control system. Authentication examines the identity credentials provided by a subject that is requesting access, and based on information in the access control list, either grants (accepts) access, denies it, or requests additional credential information, such as an additional identification factor. Next, the access control system authorizes (grants permission to) the subject, allowing the subject to have access to various other objects in the system. Accounting is the process of keeping logs or other records that show access requests, whether those were granted or not, and a history of what resources in the system that subject then accessed. Accounting functions may also be carried out at the object level, in effect keeping a separate set of records as to which subjects attempted access to a particular object, when, and what happened as a result. Tailoring these three functions allows the SSCP to meet the particular CIANA needs of the organization by balancing complexity, cost, and runtime resource utilization.\n",
    "### Proofing\n",
    "Explain the role of identity proofing in identity lifecycle management. Proofing an identity is the process of verifying the correctness and the authenticity of the supporting information used to demonstrate that a person (or other subject) is in fact the same entity that the supporting information claims that they are. For example, many free email systems require an applicant to provide a valid credit or debit card, issued in the applicant’s name, as part of the application process. This is then tested (or “proofed”) against the issuing bank, and if the card is accepted by that bank, then at least this one set of supporting identity information has been found acceptable. The degree of required information security dictates the degree of trust placed in the identity (and your ability to authenticate it), and this then places a greater trust in the proofing of that identity. For individual (human) identities, a growing number of online identity proofing systems provide varying levels of trust and confidence to systems owners and operators that job applicants, customers, or others seeking access to their systems are who (or what) they claim to be.\n",
    "### Provisioning/De-Provisioning\n",
    "### Maintenance\n",
    "### Entitlement\n",
    "### Identity & Access Management (IAM) Systems\n",
    "Explain what is meant by the evolution of identity and its impact on information security. Traditionally, identity in information systems terms was specific to human end users needing access to systems objects (such as processes, information assets, or other users); this was user-to-applications access, since even a system-level application (such as a command line interpreter) is an application program per se. This has evolved to consider applications themselves as subjects, for example, and in Web service or service-oriented architectures (SOA), this involves all layers of the protocol stack. Privacy and the individual civil rights of users also are driving the need to provide a broad, integrated approach to letting users manage the information about themselves, particularly the use of personally identifying information (PII) as part of identity and access management systems. Fortunately, this evolution is occurring at a time when open and common standards and frameworks, such as the Identity Assurance Framework, are becoming more commonly used and are undergoing further development. The concept of identity will no doubt continue to involve as we embrace both the Internet of Things and greater use of artificial intelligence systems and robots.\n"

    "## Implement Access Controls\n",
    "Explain the different approaches that access control systems use to grant or deny access. Role-based access control (RBAC) systems operate with privileges associated with the organizational roles or duties assigned, typically to individual people. For example, a new employee working in the human resources department would not be expected to need access to customer-related transaction histories. Similarly, chief financial officers (CFOs) may have to approve transactions above a certain limit, but they probably should not be originating transactions of any size (using separation of duties to preclude a whaling attack, for example). Attribute-based access control systems look at multiple characteristics (or attributes) of a subject, an object, or the environment to authorize or restrict access. That said, CFOs might be blocked from authorizing major transactions outside of certain hours, on weekends, or if logged on from an IP address in a possibly untrustworthy location. Subject-based access control is focused on the requesting subject and applying roles or attributes as required to grant or deny access. Subject-based and object-based access control systems associate attributes and constraint checking against them with each subject and with each object, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Describe the different privileges that access control systems can authorize to subjects. Subjects attempt to do something with or to an object, learn something about it, or request a service from it. Access control has to compare the privileges already assigned to the subject with the conditions, constraints or other factors pertaining to the object and type of access requested, to determine whether to grant access or deny it. These privileges may involve requests to read data from it, or read metadata kept in the system about the object; modify its contents, or the metadata; delete or extend it (that is, request that additional systems resources, such as space in memory or in storage, be allocated to it); load it as an executable process or thread for execution by a CPU; assign privileges or attributes to it; read, change, or delete access control system criteria, conditions, or rules associated with the object; pass or grant permissions to the object; copy or move it to another location; or even ask for historical information about other access requests made about that object. In systems that implement subject ownership of objects, passing ownership is also a privilege to control. Each of these kinds of operations may be worth considering as a privilege that the access control system can either grant or deny.\n",
    "### Mandatory\n",
    "### Non-Discretionary\n",
    "Compare and contrast discretionary and nondiscretionary access control policies. Mandatory (also called nondiscretionary) policies are rules that are enforced uniformly across all subjects and objects within a system’s boundary. This constrains subjects granted such access (1) from passing information about such objects to any other subject or object; (2) attempting to grant or bequeath its own privileges to another subject; (3) changing any security attribute on any subject, object, or other element of the system; (4) granting or choosing the security attributes of newly created or modified objects (even if this subject created or modified them); and (5) changing any of the rules governing access control. Discretionary access policies are also uniformly enforced on all subjects and objects in the system, but depending on those rules, such subjects or objects may be able to do one or more of the tasks that are prohibited under a mandatory policy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Describe the key attributes of the reference monitor in access control systems. In abstract or conceptual terms, the reference monitor is a subject (a system, machine, or program) that performs all of the functions necessary to carry out the access control for an information system. Typically, it must be resistant to tampering, must always be invoked when access is requested or attempted, and must be small enough to allow thorough analysis and verification of its functions, design, and implementation in hardware, software, and procedures. It can be placed within hardware, operating systems, applications, or anywhere we need it to be, as long as such placement can meet those conditions. The security kernel is the reference monitor function within an operating system; the trusted computing base is the hardware and firmware implementation of the reference monitor (and other functions) in a processor or motherboard.\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain how Biba and Bell-LaPadula, as access control models, contribute to information security. Each of these models is focused on a different information security attribute or characteristic. Bell-LaPadula was designed to meet the Department of Defense’s need for systems that could handle multiple levels of classified information; it focuses on confidentiality by providing restrictions on “read up”—that is, accessing information at a higher level than the process is cleared for—or “write-down” of classified information into a process or environment at a lower security level. Biba is focused on protecting data integrity, and so it restricts higher-level tasks from reading from lower-level tasks (to prevent the higher-level task from possibly being contaminated with incorrect data or malware), while allowing reads from lower-level to higher-level tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain Type 1 and Type 2 errors and their impacts in an identity management and access control context. Type 1 errors are false negatives, also called a false rejection, which incorrectly identify a legitimate subject as an intruder; this can result in delays or disruptions to users getting work done or achieving their otherwise legitimate system usage accomplished. Type 2 errors are false positives or false acceptances, in which unknown subjects, or authorized users or subjects exceeding their privileges, are incorrectly allowed access to systems or objects. Type 2 errors can allow unauthorized subjects (users or tasks) to access system information resources, take action, exfiltrate data, or take other harmful actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain the roles of remediation and quarantine in network access control. Network access control systems can be programmed to inspect or challenge (interrogate) devices that are attempting to connect to the network, which can check for a deficiency such as software updates not applied, malware definitions not current, or other conditions. Systems with otherwise legitimate, trusted credentials that fail these checks can be routed to remediation servers, which only allow the user access to and execution/download of the required fixes. For network access control, quarantine (which is also called captive portals) is similar in concept but deals with client systems attempting an HTTP or HTTPS connection that fails such tests. These are restricted to a limited set of webpages that provide instructions on how to remediate the client’s shortcomings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Describe the use of TACACS, RADIUS, and other network access control technologies. Network access control systems use authentication methods to validate that a subject (device or user) is whom or what they claim to be and that they are authorized to conduct access requests to sets of systems resources, and to account for such access requests, authorization, and resource use. Different access control technologies do these “AAA” tasks differently, achieving different levels of information security. Access control systems need a database of some sort that contains the information about authorized subjects, their privileges, and any constraints on access or use; this is often called an access control list (ACL). (Keep separate in your mind that routers and firewalls are often programmed with filter conditions and logic, as part of access control, by means of ACLs contained in the router’s control memory. Two kinds of ACLs, two different places, working different aspects of the same overall problem.)\n",
    "Terminal Access Controller Access Control System (TACACS) was an early attempt to develop network access capabilities, largely for Unix-based systems. (The “terminal” meant either a “dumb” CRT-keyboard terminal, a very thin client, or a remote card reader/printer job entry system.) XTACACS, or extended TACACS, was a Cisco proprietary extension to TACACS. TACACS+ grew out of both efforts, as an entirely new set of protocols that separate the authentication, authorization, and accounting functions, which provides greater security and control.\n",
    "Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS) started with trying to control access to hosts by means of dial-in connections, typically using dumb terminals and thin clients. It works with (not in place of) a network access control server, which maintains the ACL information, to validate the request, deny it, or ask for additional information from the requestor. RADIUS has continued to be popular and effective, especially as it supports roaming for mobile end-user devices. An enhanced version of RADIUS, called Diameter, never gained momentum in the marketplace.\n",
