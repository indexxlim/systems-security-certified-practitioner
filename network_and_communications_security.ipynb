    "# Network & Communications Security\n",
    "\n",
    "Communications security is about data in motion - as it is going to and from the endpoints and the other elements or nodes of our systems, such as servers. It's not about data at rest or data in use, per se.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key ingredients that we find in any communications system or process are:\n",
    "* **Purpose or intent**. This intention should shape the whole communication process. With a clear statement of intent, the sender can better identify who the target audience is, and whether the intention can be achieved by exchanging one key idea or a whole series of ideas woven together into some kind of story or narrative.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Senders and recipients**. The actual people or groups on both ends of the conversation or the call; sometimes called the parties to the communication.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Protocols** that shape how the conversation or communication can start, how it is conducted, and how it is brought to a close. Protocols include a choice of language, character or symbol set, and maybe even a restricted domain of ideas to communicate about. Protocols provide for ways to detect errors in transmission or receipt, and ways to confirm that the recipient both received and understood the message as sent. Other protocols might also verify whether the true purpose of the communication got across as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Message Content**, which is the ideas we wish to exchange encoded or represented in the chosen language, character or symbol sets, and protocols.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* A physical **communications medium**, which is what makes transporting the message from one place to another possible. \n",
    "\n",
    "As we dig further into what information security entails, we'll have to add two additional and very important attributes to our **CIA** triad: **nonrepudiation** and **authentication**. Thus, **CIANA**: confidentiality, integrity, availability, nonrepudiation, and authentication.\n",
    "\n",
    "To **repudiate** something means to attempt to deny an action that you've performed or something you said. You can also attempt to deny that you ever received a particular message or didn't see or notice that someone else performed an action. In most cases, we repudiate our own actions or the actions of others so as to attempt to deny responsibility for them. Thus, **nonrepudiation** is the characteristic of a communications system that prevents a user from claiming that they never sent or never received a particular message. This communications system characteristic sets limits on what senders or receivers can do by restricting or preventing any attempt by either party to repudiate a message, its content, or its meaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Authentication, in this context, also pertains to senders and receivers. **Authentication** is the verification that the sender or receiver is who they claim to be, and then the further validation that they have been granted permission to use that communications system. Authentication might also go further by validating that a particular sender has been granted the privilege of communicating with a particular sender."

These implementations present the features of the protocol stack as services that can be requested by subjects (people or software tasks).\n",
    "\n",
    "A **datagram** is the unit of information used by a protocol layer or a function within it. It’s the unit of measure of information in each individual transfer.

    "**TCP/IP** is often thought of as the designer's and builder's choice for hardware and network systems, as a bottom-up set of standards (from Physical on up to Transport). The **OSI reference model** provides a more cohesive framework for analyzing and designing the total information flow that gets user-needed purposes implemented and carried out. SSCPs need to be fluent in both.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **handshake** is a sequence of small, simple communications that we send and receive, such as hello and goodbye, ask and reply, or acknowledge or not-acknowledge, which control and carry out the communications we need. Handshakes are defined in the protocols we agree to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each **packet** is sent across the Internet by itself (wrapped in header and trailer information that identifies the sender, recipient, and other important information we'll go into later). Breaking a large file into packets, rather than sent in one contiguous block of data, allows smarter trade-offs between actual throughput rate and error rates and recovery strategies. (Rather than resend the entire file because line noise corrupted one or two bytes, we might need to resend just the one corrupted packet.) However, since sending each packet requires a certain amount of handshake overhead to package, address, route, send, receive, unpack, and acknowledge, the smaller the packet size, the less efficient the overall communications system can be.\n",

It's not until the Physical layer connections that signals actually move from one system to another.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Routing** is the process of determining what path or set of paths to use to send a set of data from one endpoint device through the network to another. **Switching** is the process used by one node to receive data on one of its input ports and choose which output port to send the data to. A simple switch depends on the incoming data stream to explicitly state which path to send the data out on; a router, by contrast, uses routing information and routing algorithms to decide what to tell its built-in switch to properly route each incoming packet.\n",

    "The **DNS (Domain Name System)** consists of a set of servers that resolve domain names into IP addresses, registrars that assign and issue both IP addresses and the domain names associated with them to parties who want them, and the regulatory processes that administer all of that.\n",

    "| We need to consider two kinds of physical transmission: **conduction** and **radiation**. <br><br> Conducted and radiated signals are easy prey to a few problems: <br><br> * Spoofing happens when another transmitter acts in ways to get a receiver to mistake it as the anticipated sender. This can happen accidentally, such as when the RFI (radio frequency interference) from a lightning strike is misinterpreted by an electronic device as some kind of command or data input. More often, spoofing is deliberate. <br><br> * Large electrical motors, and electric power systems, can generate electromagnetic interference (EMI); this tends to be very low frequency but can still disrupt some Layer $1$ activities. <br><br> * Interception happens when a third party is able to covertly receive and decode the signals being sent, without interrupting the flow from sender to receiver. <br><br> * Jamming occurs when a stronger signal (generated deliberately, accidentally, or naturally) drowns out the signal from the transmitter. <br><br> For hostile (deliberate) threat actors, the common attack tools at Layer 1 start with physical access to your systems: <br><br> * Cable taps (passive or with active repeaters). <br><br> * Cables plugged into unused jacks on your switches, routers, or modems. <br><br> * Tampering with your local electrical power supply system. <br><br> Wi-Fi reconnaissance can be easily conducted from a smartphone app, and this can reveal exploitable weaknesses in your systems at Layer $1$ and above. This can aid an attacker in tuning their own Wi-Fi attack equipment to the right channel and pointing it in the right spots in your Wi-Fi coverage patterns, to find potential attack vectors. | The basics of the medium should provide some degree of protection against some source of interference, disruption, or interception. Signal cables can be contained in rigid pipes, and these are buried in the ground or embedded in concrete walls. This reduces the effect of RFI while also reducing the chance of the cable being cut or tapped into. Radio communications systems can be designed to use frequency bands, encoding techniques, and other measures that reduce accidental or deliberate interference or disruption. Placing Layer $1$ (and other) communications systems elements within physically secured, environmentally stabilized physical spaces should always be part of your risk mitigation thinking. <br><br> This also is part of placing your physical infrastructure under effective configuration management and change control. <br><br> Power conditioning equipment can also alleviate many hard-to-identify problems. Not every electronic device behaves well when its AC power comes with bursts of noise, or with voltage drops or spikes that aren't severe enough to cause a shutdown (or a blown surge suppressor). Some consumer or SOHO routers, and some cable or fiber modems provided by ISPs to end users, can suffer from such problems. Overheating can also cause such equipment to perform erratically. <br><br> Note that most IPS and IDS products and approaches don't have any real way to reach down into Layer $1$ to detect an intrusion. What you're left with is the old-fashioned approach of inspection and audit of the physical systems against a controlled, well-documented baseline. | In general terms, the untreated Layer $1$ risks end up being passed on to Layer $2$ and above in the protocol stacks, either as interruptions of service, datagram errors, faulty address and control information, or increased retry rates leading to decreased throughput. Monitoring and analysis of monitoring data may help you identify an incipient problem, especially if you're getting a lot of red flags from higher layers in the protocol stack. <br><br> Perhaps the worst residual risk at Layer $1$ is that you won't detect trespass at this level. Internet-empowered systems can lull us into complacency; they can let us stop caring about where a particular Cat $5$ or Cat $6$ cable actually goes, because we're too worried about authorized users doing the wrong thing or unauthorized users hacking into our systems or our apps. True, the vast majority of attacks happen remotely and involve no physical access to your Layer $1$ systems or activities. |\n",

    "Transport layer protocols primarily work with ports. **Ports** are software-defined labels for the connections between two processes, usually ones that are running on two different computers. The source and destination port, plus the protocol identification and other protocol-related information, are contained in that protocol’s header.

As we became more aware of the IPv4 address space being exhausted, NAT became an incredibly popular workaround, a way to sidestep running out of IP addresses. Although it lives at Layer $3$, NAT won't work right if it cannot reach into the other layers of the stack (and the traffic) as it needs to.\n",

    "\n",
    "* **Point-to-point** is the simplest topology: two nodes, with one link between them. This is sometimes called **peer-to-peer** if the two nodes have relatively the same set of privileges and responsibilities with respect to each other (that is, neither node is in control of the other).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Bus** topologies or networks connect multiple nodes together, one after the other, in series. The bus provides the infrastructure for sending signals to all of the nodes, and for sending addressing information (sometimes called device select) that allows each node to know when to listen to the data and when to ignore it.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Ring** networks are a series of point-to-point-to-point connections, with the last node on the chain looped back to connect to the first. Rings are designed to provide either a unidirectional or bidirectional flow of control and data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Star** networks have one central node that is connected to multiple other nodes via point-to-point connections. Unlike a point-to-point network, the node in the center has to provide (at least some) services to control and administer the network. The central node is therefore a server (since it provides services to others on the star network), and the other nodes are all clients of that server.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Mesh** networks in general provide multiple point-to-point connections between some or all of the nodes in the mesh. Mesh designs can be uniform (all nodes have point-to-point connections to all other nodes), or contain subsets of nodes with different degrees of interconnection. As a result, mesh designs can have a variety of client-server, server-to-server, or peer-to-peer relationships built into them. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Network Relationships (e.g., Peer to Peer, Client Server)\n",
    "Explain the different network roles of peer, client, and server. Each node on a network interacts with other nodes on the network, and in doing so they provide services to each other. All such interactions are governed by or facilitated by the use of handshake protocols. If two interconnected nodes have essentially equal roles in those handshakes—one node does not control the other or have more control over the conversation—then each node is a peer, or equal, of the other. Simple peer-to-peer service provision models are used for file, printer, or other device sharing, and they are quite common. When the service being provided requires more control and management, or the enforcement of greater security measures (such as identity authentication or access control), then the relationship is more appropriately a client-server relationship. Here, the requesting client node has to make a request to the server node (the one providing the requested services); the server has to recognize the request, permit it to proceed, perform the service, and then manage the termination of the service request. Note that even in simple file or print sharing, the sharing may be peer-to-peer, but the actual use of the shared resource almost always involves a service running on the node that possesses that file or printer, which carries out the sharing of the file or the printing of the requesting node’s data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Transmission Media Types (e.g., Fiber, Wired, Wireless)\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at wireless security protocols:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Wired Equivalency Protocol (WEP)** was the first attempt at securing Wi-Fi. As the name suggests, it was a compromise intended to make some security easier to achieve, but it proved to have far too many security flaws and was easily circumvented by attackers. Its encryption was vulnerable to passive attacks, such as traffic analysis. Unauthorized mobile stations could easily use a known plaintext attack or other means to trick the WEP access point, leading to decrypting the traffic. Perhaps more seriously, it was demonstrated that about a day's worth of intercepted traffic could build a dictionary (or rainbow table) with which real-time automated decryption could be done by the attacker. Avoid its use altogether if you can.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA)** was an interim replacement while the IEEE 802.11i standard was in development. It used preshared encryption keys (PSKs, sometimes called \"WPA Personal\") while providing Temporal Key Integrity Protocol (TKIP, pronounced \"tee-kip\") for encryption. WPA Enterprise uses more robust encryption, an authentication server, or PKI certificates in the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Wi-Fi Protected Access Version 2 (WPA2)** took this the next step when IEEE 802.11i was released in 2004. Among other improvements, WPA2 brings Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithms into use.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Commonly Used Ports & Protocols\n",
    "\n",
    "Using software-defined port numbers (from $0$ to $65535$) allows protocol designers to add additional control over routing service requests: the IP packets are routed by the network between sender and recipient, but adding a port number to a Transport layer or higher payload header ensures that the receiving system knows which set of services to connect (route) that payload to. The definition of ports is mentioned in the transport layer section.\n",

    "Describe the man-in-the-middle attack, its impacts, and applicable countermeasures. In general terms, the man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack can happen when a third party can place themselves between the two nodes and either insert their own false traffic or modify traffic being exchanged between the two nodes, in order to fool one or both nodes into mistaking the third party for the other (legitimate) node. This can lead to falsified data entering company communications and files, the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information, or disruption of services and business processes. Protection at every layer of the protocol stack can reduce or eliminate the exposure to MITM attacks. Strong Wi-Fi encryption, well-configured and enforced identity management and access control, and use of secure protocols as much as possible are all important parts of a countermeasure strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Describe cache poisoning and applicable countermeasures. Every node in the network maintains a local memory or cache of address information (MAC addresses, IP addresses, URLs, etc.) to speed up communications—it takes far less time and effort to look it up in a local cache than it does to re-ask other nodes on the network to re-resolve an address, for example. Cache poisoning attacks attempt to replace legitimate information in a device cache with information that could redirect traffic to an attacker, or fool other elements of the system into mistaking an attacker for an otherwise legitimate node. This sets the system up for a man-in-the-middle attack, for example. Two favorite targets of attackers are ARP and DNS caches. A wide variety of countermeasure techniques and software tools are available; in essence, they boil down to protecting and controlling the server and using whitelisting and blacklisting techniques, but these tend not to be well suited for networks undergoing rapid growth or change."

    "Explain the need for IPSec, and briefly describe its key components. The original design of the Internet assumed that nodes connecting to the net were trustworthy; any security provisions had to be provided by user-level processes or procedures. For the 1960s, this was reasonable; by the 1980s, this was no longer acceptable. Multiple approaches, such as access control and encryption techniques, were being developed, but these did not lead to a comprehensive Internet security solution. By the early 1990s, IPSec was created to provide an open and extensible architecture that consists of a number of protocols and features used to provide greater levels of message confidentiality, integrity, authentication, and nonrepudiation protection. It does this first by creating security associations, which are sets of protocols, services, and data that provide encryption key management and distribution services. Then, using the IP Security Authentication Header (AH), it establishes secure, connectionless integrity. The Encapsulating Security Payloads (ESP) protocol uses these to provide confidentiality, connectionless integrity, and anti-replay protection, and authenticates the originator of the data (thus providing a degree of nonrepudiation).\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain how physical placement of security devices affects overall network information security. Physical device placement of security components determines the way network traffic at Layer 1 can be scanned, filtered, blocked, modified, or allowed to pass unchanged. It also directly affects what traffic can be monitored by the security system as a whole. For wired and fiber connections, devices can be placed inline—that is, on the connection from a secured to a non-secured environment. All traffic therefore flows through the security device. Placement of the device in a central segment of the network (or anywhere else) not only limits its direct ability to inspect and control traffic as it attempts to flow through, but may also limit how well it can handle or inspect traffic for various subnets in your overall LAN. This is similar to host-based versus LAN-based antimalware protection. Actual placement decisions need to be made based on security requirements, risk tolerance, affordability, and operability considerations.\n",

Management functions can direct devices in the network to change their operational characteristics, isolate them from some or all of the network, or take other maintenance actions on them. These three sets of functions can easily be visualized as three map overlays, which you can place over the diagram of the network devices themselves. \n",

Traffic shaping and load balancing systems attempt to look at network traffic (and the connections it wants to make to systems resources) and avoid overloading one set of links or resources while leaving others unused or under-utilized. They may use static parameters, preset by systems administrators, or dynamically compute the parameters they need to accomplish their tasks. Traffic shaping is primarily a bandwidth management approach, allocating more bandwidth for higher-priority traffic. Load balancing tries to spread workloads across multiple servers. This trending and current monitoring information could be useful in detecting anomalous system usage, such as a distributed denial-of-service attack or a data exfiltration taking place. It may also provide a statistical basis for what is “normal” and what is “abnormal” loading on the system, as another indication of a potential security event of interest in the making.
